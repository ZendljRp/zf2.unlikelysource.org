-- Contains source code for a complete ZF2 app.
-- You can use the modules separately.
-- NOTE: the app is configured to look for ZF2 in /vendor/ZF2
   if this is not the case, you will need to alter /public/index.php accordingly
-- vendor/ZfcBase and vendor/ZfcUser are from the ZF Commons project base and user modules
-- You can use composer to install all dependencies as follows:
   cd /path/to/this/directory
   php composer.phar self-update
   php composer.phar install
