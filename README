Contains source code for a complete ZF2 app.
You can use the modules separately.
NOTE: the app is configured to look for ZF2 in /vendor/ZF2
if this is not the case, you will need to alter /public/index.php accordingly
vendor/ZfcBase and vendor/ZfcUser are from the ZF Commons project base and user modules
